### Seedbed Curse [8193]

Curse grown on a corpse killed and defiled by the Dung Eater. A tender pox afflicted with omen horns.

The Dung Eater cultivates the seedbed curse on corpses.

By doing so he prevents dead souls returning to the Erdtree, leaving them forever cursed. One of the most loathsome things found in all the Lands Between.
