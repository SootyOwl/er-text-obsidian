### Giant Rat Ashes +10 [233010]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirits of five giant rats.

Spirits that do not require FP to summon. The rat spirits appear at a distance from the summoner, swarming upon their victim to start the fight. These vermin once seemed to multiply incessantly, but their fecundity in death has abated for now.
