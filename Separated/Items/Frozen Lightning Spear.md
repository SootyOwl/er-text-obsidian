### Frozen Lightning Spear [6921]

Incantation that channels the power of the Dragonkin Soldiers.

Creates a spear of ice lightning and stabs it into the ground from above. On impact, the spear will burst into trails of lightning advancing forwards.

The Dragonkin were born in the Eternal City, where they knew no true sky, nor true lightning. Instead, ice lightning was their weapon.
