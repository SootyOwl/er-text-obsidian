### Giant Rat Ashes [233000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirits of three giant rats.

Spirits that do not require FP to summon. The rat spirits appear at a distance from the summoner, swarming upon their victim to start the fight. Even as spirits, these vermin seem to multiply endlessly. Enhancing these ashes can increase their numbers.
