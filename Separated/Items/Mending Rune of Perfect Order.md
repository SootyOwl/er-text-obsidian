### Mending Rune of Perfect Order [8182]

Rune discovered by the noble Goldmask. Used to restore the fractured Elden Ring when brandished by the Elden Lord.

A rune of transcendental ideology which will attempt to perfect the Golden Order.

The current imperfection of the Golden Order, or instability of ideology, can be blamed upon the fickleness of the gods no better than men. That is the fly in the ointment.
