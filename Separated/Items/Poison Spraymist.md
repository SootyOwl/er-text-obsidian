### Poison Spraymist [3580]

Forbidden art of depraved perfumers. Craftable with a perfume bottle.

Uses FP to release a poison mist from user's mouth, causing a buildup of poison.

Perfumed powder is held in the mouth to dissolve before being expelled. It was once a restorative art, or so it is said.
