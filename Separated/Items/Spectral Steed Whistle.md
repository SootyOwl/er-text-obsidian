### Spectral Steed Whistle [130]

A delicate goldwork ring. Can be used as a finger whistle.

Sound the whistle to summon and ride Torrent, the spectral steed. (Dismounts steed when used while on horseback.)

Upon his death, the spectral steed can be summoned again, but doing so drains the Flask of Crimson Tears.
