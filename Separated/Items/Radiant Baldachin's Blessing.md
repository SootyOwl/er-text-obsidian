### Radiant Baldachin's Blessing [3361]

Protection of a hidden temple in the guise of a bedchamber. This blessing is of the utmost rarity.

Uses FP to temporarily raise poise. The effect lasts longer than a mere favor.

It's said a deathbed companion will only produce a blessing of this kind for a champion but once in her entire life. The sole blessing which she imbues of her own volition.
