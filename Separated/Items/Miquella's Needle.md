### Miquella's Needle [2190]

One of the unalloyed gold needles that Miquella crafted to ward away the meddling of outer gods.

Capable of subduing the flame of frenzy if inherited, allowing one to cheat fate and avoid becoming Lord of Frenzied Flame.

However, the needle is as yet unfinished and can only be used in the heart of the storm beyond time said to be found in Faram Azula.
