### Dolores the Sleeping Arrow Puppet [262000]

One of Seluvis's favorite puppets. Use to summon the spirit of Dolores the Sleeping Arrow

Spirit of a handsome archer who dressed in the style of a man. Called the Silent Hunter by some, she fires St. Trina's arrows from her shortbow.

Dolores once belonged to the Roundtable Hold, where she was both a critic and a friend of Gideon the All-Knowing. It was because of her that he and Seluvis went their separate ways.
