### Mad Pumpkin Head Ashes [243000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirit of a mad pumpkin head.

Spirit of a mad soldier with a large, brawny physique. Though he has stifled his panic within the dark confines of his helmet, he rampages as if driven mad when agitated by bloodshed or the humming of insects. This mad soldier is all that is left of a broken gladiator.
