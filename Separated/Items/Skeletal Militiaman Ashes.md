### Skeletal Militiaman Ashes [212000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirits of two skeletal militiamen.

These are the spirits of militiamen who live in Death, and will continue to rise again until properly finished off. This is the grotesque fate of those who come into contact with Deathroot.
