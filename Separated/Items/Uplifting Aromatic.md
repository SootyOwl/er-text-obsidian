### Uplifting Aromatic [3500]

Art of the perfumers who fought in the Shattering. Craftable with a perfume bottle.

Uses FP to raise the attack power of the user and nearby allies while also reducing the damage from one incoming attack by half.

This aromatic has an extremely potent morale-raising effect that makes those accustomed to it fearless in the face of death. It was this influence that made the perfumers exceptional commanders.
