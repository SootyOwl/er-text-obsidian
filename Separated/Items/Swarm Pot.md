### Swarm Pot [340]

Craftable item prepared using a cracked pot. A cocktail of effluents is sealed inside.

Throw at enemies to set a swarm of bloodflies upon them. The vile swarm deals damage and builds up onset of blood loss. The cacophony of their wings assails the sanity of berserkers.

The maggots found in waste feed on blood and turn into vicious flies that are pitiably short-lived.
