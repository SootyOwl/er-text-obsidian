### Remembrance of the Blasphemous [2953]

Remembrance of Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy, hewn into the Erdtree.

The power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader. Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.

Rykard took the form of a giant serpent that he might devour, grow, and live eternally. "I understand. The road of blasphemy is long and perilous. One cannot walk it unprepared to sin."
