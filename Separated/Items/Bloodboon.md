### Bloodboon [6310]

Sacred incantation of Mohg, Lord of Blood.

Thrust arm into the body of the Formless Mother, then scatter the bloodflame to set the area ablaze. This incantation can be cast while in motion.

The mother of truth craves wounds. When Mohg stood before her, deep underground, his accursed blood erupted with fire, and he was besotted with the defilement that he was born into.
