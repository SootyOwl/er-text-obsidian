### Inescapable Frenzy [7300]

Incantation originating from the maddening Three Fingers.

Causes the yellow flame of frenzy to blaze from the caster's eyes. The caster then latches onto foes, spreading the madness. This incantation also causes buildup of madness in the caster, and is only effective against Tarnished.

To gaze into one another's eyes is truly the most intimate form of human contact.
