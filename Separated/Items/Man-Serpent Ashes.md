### Man-Serpent Ashes [229000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirit of a man-serpent.

Spirit of a deformed man-serpent that wields a whip of magma. It is said that long ago, the elder serpent that dwelled on Mt. Gelmir devoured a demigod, and the birth of the man-serpents followed.
