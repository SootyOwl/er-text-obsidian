### Starlight [4140]

One of the glintstone sorceries of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.

Creates a small, floating star light that illuminates surroundings. This sorcery can be cast while in motion.

Granted to sorcerers who depart from the academy to embark on journeys. Even during the blackest nights, sojourns underground, or imprisonment in gaol, the stars are never far from a sorcerer's side.
