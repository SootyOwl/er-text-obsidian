### Imbued Sword Key [8186]

Stone key shaped like a sword. A special item, imbued with rich blue magic.

Breaks the seal on the imp statues guarding the sending gates enshrined in each belfry, but remains embedded in the statue after use, meaning it can only be used once as an item.

Think well before using one.
