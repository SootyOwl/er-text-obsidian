### Shard Spiral [4030]

One of the glintstone sorceries of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.

Fires twin projectiles that form a spiral as they travel. This sorcery can be cast repeatedly and while in motion. Charging enhances potency.

A sorcery of the Karolos Conspectus, the most venerable of the academy. This was the product of a failed attempt to create a new comet.
