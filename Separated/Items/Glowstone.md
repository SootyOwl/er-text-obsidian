### Glowstone [2030]

Polished Ruin Fragment that shines brighter than Rainbow Stone. Craftable item.

Emits light from the location it is placed, illuminating surroundings. However, the effect is short-lived, and it lacks the diverse colors of rainbow stones.

May serve some benefit in dark places, or at night.
