### Cursemark of Death [8191]

Cursemark carved into the discarded flesh of Ranni the Witch. Also known as the half-wheel wound of the centipede.

This cursemark was carved at the moment of Death of the first demigod, and should have taken the shape of a circle.

However, two demigods perished at the same time, breaking the cursemark into two half-wheels.

Ranni was the first of the demigods whose flesh perished, while the Prince of Death perished in soul alone.
