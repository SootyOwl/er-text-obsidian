### Soldjars of Fortune Ashes [246000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirits of three little living jars. Summoning consumes HP rather than FP.

These reckless spirits sacrifice themselves to vanquish their summoner's foes, and explode upon death. Though their bravery is admirable, their explosions can harm friend as well as foe, and they will also immediately explode on contact with fire.

"Tell the othersâ€”tell them how brightly a fire jar burns."
