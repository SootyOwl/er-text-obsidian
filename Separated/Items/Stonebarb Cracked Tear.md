### Stonebarb Cracked Tear [11026]

A crystal tear formed slowly over the ages where the Erdtree's bounty falls to the ground.

Can be mixed in the Flask of Wondrous Physick. The resulting concoction makes one's attacks more likely to break enemy stances. However, the effect lasts only for a short time.
