### Mimic Tear Ashes [207000]

Legendary ashen remains. Use to summon the spirit of a mimic tear. Summoning consumes HP rather than FP.

This spirit takes the form of the summoner to fight alongside them, but its mimicry does not extend to imitating the summoner's will. Mimic tears are the result of an attempt by the Eternal City to forge a lord.
