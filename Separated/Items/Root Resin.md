### Root Resin [20775]

Resin secreted from the roots of the Greattree. Can also be found near trees on the surface. Material used in crafting items.

The roots of the Greattree were once linked to those of the Erdtree, or so they say, and it is for this reason catacombs are built around Greattree roots.
