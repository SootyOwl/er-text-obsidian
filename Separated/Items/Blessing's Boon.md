### Blessing's Boon [6430]

One of the ancient Erdtree incantations.

Grants a blessing to the caster and nearby allies, gradually restoring HP. Hold to continue praying and delay activation.

Blessings once fell like tears from the Erdtree, and this incantation is but a lingering remnant of their power.
