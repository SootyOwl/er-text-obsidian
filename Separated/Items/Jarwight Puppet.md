### Jarwight Puppet [263000]

One of Seluvis's puppets. Use to summon the spirit of a jarwight

Spirit of a man who wished to become the innards of a living jar. A jar-hurling specialist who throws all manner of pots and jars.

The warrior jar once told the nameless man this: "You are not yet ready to join the warriors inside. No, you must apply yourself! Better yourself, and one day I will return for you." [2290] Grace that dwells within the inhabitants of The Lands Between; the lingering residue of gold.

Use to gain many runes.

Grace was brought to the very fringes and lowlands of the Lands Between. And with the Golden Order came the weight of its history. A history of conquest and subjugation.
