### Golden Seed [10010]

A golden seed, found at the base of an illusory tree.

Increases a Sacred Flask's number of uses. (Can be used after resting at a site of grace.)

When the Elden Ring was shattered, these seeds flew from the Erdtree, scattering across the various lands, as if life itself knew that its end had come.
