### Flask of Crimson Tears [1001]

A sacred flask modelled after a golden holy chalice that was once graced by a tear of blessing.

Filled with crimson tears, this flask restores HP with use. Rest at a site of grace to replenish.

The one washed up on the gravesite was sure to die, until this flask offered its gift of rejuvenation. To seek the Elden Ring.
