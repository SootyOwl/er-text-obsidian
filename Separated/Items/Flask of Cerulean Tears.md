### Flask of Cerulean Tears [220]

A sacred flask modelled after a golden holy chalice that was once graced by a tear of life.

Filled with cerulean tears, this flask restores FP with use. Though currently empty, simply rest at a site of grace to replenish.

It is said that a Finger Maiden will bestow two such chalices upon the chosen Tarnished when they meet.
