### Great Glintstone Shard [4001]

One of the glintstone sorceries of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.

The glintstone serves as a conduit, launching large magical projectiles at foes. This sorcery can be cast repeatedly and while in motion.

Those unworthy of the stone crown typically end their brief journey into sorcery here.
