### Glintstone Icecrag [4400]

Sorcery said to have been used by the old snow witch.

The glintstone serves as a conduit, launching a mass of cold magic. This sorcery can be cast repeatedly and while in motion.

The snowy crone taught the young Ranni to fear the dark moon as she imparted her cold sorcery.
