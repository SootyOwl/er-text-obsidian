### Larval Tear [8185]

Core of a creature of mimicry known as a silver tear. As much a substance as it is a living organism.

Material required by the amber egg cradled by Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, to birth people anew.

Being born anew allows the reallocation of attributes boosted by leveling up.
