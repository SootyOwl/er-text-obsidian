### Catch Flame [6000]

Incantation originating from a sinister prophecy.

Momentarily sparks flame from the caster's hand. This incantation can be cast without delay after performing another action.

The flame of ruin is anathema to the Erdtree. But prophets sometimes glimpse it within the faith all the same. Sadly when this occurs their sole reward is banishment.
