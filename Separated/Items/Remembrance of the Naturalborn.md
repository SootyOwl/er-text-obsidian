### Remembrance of the Naturalborn [2964]

Remembrance of Astel, Naturalborn of the Void, hewn into the Erdtree.

The power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader. Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.

A malformed star born in the lightless void far away. Once destroyed an Eternal City and took away their sky. An falling star of ill omen.
