### Shadow Bait [6520]

Incantation of the Two Fingers' servants, who once served as the assassins of the Roundtable Hold.

Creates a pale gold shadow before the caster, luring foes of human build and attracting their aggression. This incantation can be cast while in motion or crouching, and will still affect foes that are already in a combat state.

It is said that those beguiled by the shadow see within it a hated foe.
