### Amber Starlight [8142]

An ephemeral sliver that gives off a pale amber glow. What remains of a passing flash of starlight.

If the stars command our fates, then amber-hued stars must command the fates of the gods. Such is the belief that inspired the use of these shards to prepare a most special draught.
