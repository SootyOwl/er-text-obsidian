### Perfumer Tricia [217000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirit of Tricia, the perfumer.

Tricia was once known as a healer who dedicated her efforts to treating Misbegotten, Omen, and all those seen as impure. When her efforts failed, she was their companion as they died, watching over them to ensure that they could pass peacefully, free of pain.

A tale akin to the origins of the deathbed companions.
