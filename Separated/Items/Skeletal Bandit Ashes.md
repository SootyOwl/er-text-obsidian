### Skeletal Bandit Ashes [213000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirit of a skeletal bandit.

This is the spirit of a bandit who lives in Death, and will continue to rise again until properly finished off. After the night of the plot, Deathroot appeared in the Lands Between, and Those Who Live in Death soon followed.
