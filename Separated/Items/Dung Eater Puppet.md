### Dung Eater Puppet [260000]

One of Seluvis's puppets. Use to summon the spirit of the Dung Eater.

Spirit of a man who murdered thousands and defiled their corpses with the Seedbed Curse. Wields a spine greatsword and hurls curses.

The Dung Eater despaired at how he met his end. How hideous and sinister this puppet is, and yet, its utter despair invites one to care for it.
