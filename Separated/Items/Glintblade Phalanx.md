### Glintblade Phalanx [4300]

One of the sorceries of the Carian royal family.

Creates a defensive arch of magic glintblades overhead, which automatically attack nearby foes. This sorcery can be cast while in motion.

Bestowed upon the enchanted Carian knights, who combined this art with their swordsmanship to maintain pressure upon their foes, striking in waves of steel and sorcery.
