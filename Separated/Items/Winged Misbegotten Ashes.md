### Winged Misbegotten Ashes [210000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirit of a winged misbegotten.

A spirit with the aspect of wings which takes flight to loose arrows from its bow. The misbegotten are held to be a punishment for making contact with the Crucible, and from birth they are treated as slaves, or worse.
