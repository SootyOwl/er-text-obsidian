### About Roundtable Hold [9132]

The Roundtable Hold is a place where Tarnished gather, guided by grace. Combat is prohibited on the premises due to a pact of non-aggression. (This rule is in effect when the Roundtable icon is displayed.)

The Roundtable Hold is located outside of this world. It can only be reached through sites of grace. (Can also be accessed by using the map to travel.)
