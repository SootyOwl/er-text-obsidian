### Thorny Cracked Tear [11013]

A crystal tear formed slowly over the ages where the Erdtree's bounty falls to the ground.

Can be mixed in the Flask of Wondrous Physick. The resulting concoction makes consecutive attacks grow stronger the longer they continue. However, the effect lasts only for a short time.
