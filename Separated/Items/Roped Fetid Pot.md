### Roped Fetid Pot [430]

Craftable item prepared using a cracked pot. A cocktail of effluents is sealed inside, and a short rope that aids throwing has been secured around the pot.

Throw at rearward enemies to cause buildup of deadly poison.

Beware though; those who carry these pots will slowly accumulate poison in their own bodies.

Push someone in a privy; expect to get dung on your hands.
