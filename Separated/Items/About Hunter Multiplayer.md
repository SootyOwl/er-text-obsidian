### About Hunter Multiplayer [9125]

If you use a Blue Cipher Ring, you will make yourself open to summons for rescue from other worlds.

The multiplayer session will begin once you have been summoned as a hunter, and your objective is to defeat the invader of that world.

The compass at the top of the screen indicates the direction of the summoner (Host of Fingers).
