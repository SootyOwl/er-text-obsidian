### Clayman Ashes [222000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirits of two claymen.

Bowed with age, these spirits are sluggish but hard to stagger. The warped remains of priests who searched for revelation in service of the ancient dynasty, they employ two sorceries that produce smaller and larger bubbles.
