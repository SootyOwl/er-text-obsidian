### Crimson Bubbletear [11007]

A crystal tear formed slowly over the ages where the Erdtree's bounty falls to the ground.

Can be mixed in the Flask of Wondrous Physick. The resulting concoction automatically heals one's HP in the moment before death.

However, this effect only occurs once, and will expire after a certain duration.
