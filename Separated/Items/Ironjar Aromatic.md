### Ironjar Aromatic [3520]

Forbidden art of depraved perfumers. Craftable with a perfume bottle.

Uses FP to temporarily turn body to steel, boosting poise, resistances and damage negation at the expense of mobility and vulnerability to lightning.

An art that requires fragments of hunted noble jars. Depraved perfumers are plainly in league with jar poachers.
