### Mending Rune of the Fell Curse [8184]

Loathsome rune gestated by the Dung Eater. Used to restore the fractured Elden Ring when brandished by the Elden Lord.

The reviled curse will last eternally, and the world's children, grandchildren, and every generation hence, will be its pustules.

If Order is defiled entirely, defilement is defilement no more, and for every curse, a cursed blessing.
