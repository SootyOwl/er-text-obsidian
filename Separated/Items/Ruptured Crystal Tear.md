### Ruptured Crystal Tear [11016]

A crystal tear formed slowly over the ages where the Erdtree's bounty falls to the ground.

Can be mixed in the Flask of Wondrous Physick. Causes the resulting concoction to explode.

A defective crystal tear which possesses absolutely no medicinal qualities. A lesson said to be learned the hard way for some; faith can be a volatile matter, after all.
