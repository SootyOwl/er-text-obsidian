### Mausoleum Soldier Ashes [254000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirits of five mausoleum soldiers.

Spirits of five headless soldiers who confound foes by disappearing and reappearing at will. The mausoleum is where the bodies of soulless demigods are lain to rest, and these soldiers followed their masters into Death by severing their own heads from their bodies.
