### Grace Mimic [2050]

A fetish indicating the guidance of grace. Craftable item.

Similar to grace, this fetish draws rays guiding the way, only without any sense of order.

Useful as a last resort for those who have lost their way, or for use by those who believe that unrefined guidance will lead to truer encounters.
