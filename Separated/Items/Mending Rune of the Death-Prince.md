### Mending Rune of the Death-Prince [8183]

Rune gestated by Fia, the Deathbed Companion. Used to restore the fractured Elden Ring when brandished by the Elden Lord.

Formed of the two hallowbrand half-wheels combined, it will embed the principle of life within Death into Order.

The Golden Order was created by confining Destined Death. Thus, this new Order will be one of Death restored.
