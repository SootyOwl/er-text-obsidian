### Dragon Heart [10060]

Dragon heart seized by a dragon tracker. Riddled with Gravel Stone, this grotesque organ continues to beat vivaciously.

An offering used in the Dragon Communion. Consume a dragon's heart at the altar to make its power yours.

While a terrible and savage-looking thing, the heart has a peculiar beauty to it.
