### About Cooperative Multiplayer [9122]

Use Tarnished's Furled Finger to write a gold summon sign.

Cooperative multiplayer will begin once you have been summoned by a player from another world.

You will take the role of an ally (Furled Finger) and your objective is to defeat the area boss.

The compass at the top of the screen indicates the direction of the summoner (Host of Fingers).
