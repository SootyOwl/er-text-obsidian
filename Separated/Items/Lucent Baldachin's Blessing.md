### Lucent Baldachin's Blessing [8102]

Sacred seal of a hidden shrine that looks much like a bedchamber. A faint light leaks through a crack in its fastened doors, as if the Firefly is beckoning to come inside.

Raise in prayer to gain protection.

Gaining protection consumes this item, but can grant unique effects. Take care though, these effects cannot be undone.
