### Vyke's Dragonbolt [6970]

Incantation of Vyke, knight of the Roundtable Hold.

Summons red lightning to bolster both the caster's body and their armament held in the right hand. Enchants armament with lightning-affinity attacks and increases maximum equipment load. However, lightning damage negation will be reduced.

Of all the knights, Vyke the Dragonspear was the one Lansseax loved the most.
