### Rock Blaster [4110]

One of the glintstone sorceries of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.

Imbues the ferrule of the caster's staff with magic, then thrusts it into the ground to create a massive magical shockwave.

Hold to continue moving without striking the ground, and then push the end of the staff into enemies.

An enhanced version of the glintstone miners' Stonedigger sorcery.
