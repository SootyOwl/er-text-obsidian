### Godrick Soldier Ashes +1 [250001]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirits of two of Godrick's soldiers.

A duo of spirits, consisting of a wielder of devastating charged hammer attacks in the vanguard and a crossbowman bringing up the rear. The soldiers who serve Godrick the Grafted are what remains of the army that fled the royal city of the Erdtree.
