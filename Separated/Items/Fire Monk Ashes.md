### Fire Monk Ashes [227000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirit of a Fire Monk.

Spirit of a stout monk who monitored the Giants' Flame. Versed in fire incantations, and himself steeled against fire. Though he was charged with keeping watch over the Flame, after many years of solemn duty, he has succumbed to its allure.
