### Regal Omen Bairn [3011]

Doll of a curseborn bairn from the Erdtree's royal line.

Uses FP to unleash many wraiths that chase down foes.

Omen babies born of royalty do not have their horns excised, but instead are kept underground, unbeknownst to anyone, imprisoned for eternity.

These memorial fetishes are fashioned in secret.
