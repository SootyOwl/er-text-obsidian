### Taunter's Tongue [108]

Item for online play. (Can also be used from the Multiplayer menu.)

Lures in invaders. This allows your world to be invaded without any Furled Finger cooperators present, and it also shortens the interval between windows of opportunity for invasion.

Additionally, enables the arrival of a second invader to join when a cooperator is present. (With two invaders, the maximum number of cooperators becomes one.)
