### Cleanrot Knight Finlay [223000]

Legendary ashen remains. Use to summon the spirit of the Cleanrot Knight Finlay.

Finlay was one of the few survivors of the Battle of Aeonia, who in an unimaginable act of heroism carried the slumbering demigod Malenia all the way back to the Haligtree. She managed the feat alone, fending off all manner of foes along the way.
