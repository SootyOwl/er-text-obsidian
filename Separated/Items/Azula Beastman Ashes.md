### Azula Beastman Ashes [230000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirits of two Azula beastmen.

Spirits of beastmen from doomed Farum Azula, the slowly crumbling ruins in the skies. These ruins are said to be the remains of a giant mausoleum enshrining an ancient dragon, guarded by chosen beastmen who wield weapons clad in lightning.
