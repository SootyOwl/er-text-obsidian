### Roped Holy Water Pot [510]

Craftable item prepared using a cracked pot. Enchanted by incantations of the Golden Order, and a short rope that aids throwing has been secured around the pot.

Consumes FP. Throw at rearward enemies to inflict holy damage.

Highly effective against Those Who Live in Death, even preventing them from rising again. The Golden Order has no mercy for those who trespass beyond life's bounds.
