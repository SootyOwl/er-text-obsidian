### Festering Bloody Finger [111]

Item for online play. (Can also be used from the Multiplayer menu.) Consumed upon use.

Attempts an invasion of another player's world. If successful, you will arrive as an invader (Bloody Finger) with the objective of defeating the Host of Fingers of that world.

This furled finger is blackened with blood congestion. It seems to have been chopped off rather unceremoniously.
