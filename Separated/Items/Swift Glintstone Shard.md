### Swift Glintstone Shard [4010]

One of the glintstone sorceries of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.

The glintstone serves as a conduit, launching swift magical projectiles at foes. This sorcery can be used without delay after performing another action.

Those unworthy of the stone crown typically end their brief journey into sorcery here.
