### Nepheli Loux Puppet [259000]

One of Seluvis's favorite puppets. Use to summon the spirit of Nepheli Loux.

Puppet of a warrior who was betrayed by her pure heart. Wields a Stormhawk Axe in both hands and uses the Thunderstorm skill.

A diamond in the rough, deserving of special care lest its potential be squandered. Nepheli Loux truly was a warrior.
