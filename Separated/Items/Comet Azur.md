### Comet Azur [4200]

Legendary sorcery devised by Azur, primeval sorcerer.

Fires a tremendous comet in a torrent akin to the distant starry expanse, the place said to be the origin of glintstone. Hold to continue releasing the sorcery's power.

When Azur glimpsed into the primeval current, he saw darkness. He was left both bewitched and fearful of the abyss.
