### Lightning Spear [6900]

One of the incantations of the capital's ancient dragon cult.

Summons a lightning spear and hurls it before the caster. Charging causes a lightning bolt to strike the point of impact.

Long ago, Godwyn the Golden defeated the ancient dragon Fortissax, and befriended his fallen foeâ€”an event that gave rise to the ancient dragon cult in the capital.
