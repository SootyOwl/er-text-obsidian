### Acid Spraymist [3610]

Forbidden art of depraved perfumers. Craftable with a perfume bottle.

Uses FP to release an acidic mist from user's mouth, damaging armaments and temporarily lowering attack power.

Perfumed powder is held in the mouth to dissolve before being expelled. It was once a restorative art, or so it is said.
