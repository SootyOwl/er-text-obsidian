### Warhawk Ashes [237000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirit of a warhawk.

Spirit of a Stormveil warhawk, the talons of which have been sliced off so that razor-fine swords could be grafted in their place. With its lord vanquished, and its wings wounded, the hawk perished as it solemnly gazed at its former home. The storm is a warhawk's cradle.
