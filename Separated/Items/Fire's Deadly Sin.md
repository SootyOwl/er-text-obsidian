### Fire's Deadly Sin [7900]

Incantation originating from a deeply ominous prophecy.

Sets both the caster and the surrounding area ablaze with raging flames. The caster's body will remain engulfed in flame for a while, burning them and any who draw near. Charging enhances potency.

The prophet despaired, looking up at the Erdtree, for soon the kindling would burst into flame, bringing ruin.

"The burning of the Erdtree is the first cardinal sin. That is not the domain of mere men."
