### Remembrance of the Rot Goddess [2954]

Remembrance of Malenia, Goddess of Rot, hewn into the Erdtree.

The power of its namesake can be unlocked by the Finger Reader. Alternatively, it can be used to gain a great bounty of runes.

Miquella and Malenia are both the children of a single god. As such they are both Empyreans, but suffered afflictions from birth. One was cursed with eternal childhood, and the other harbored rot within.
