### Flame, Fall Upon Them [6020]

One of the incantations that draws directly from the power of the Fire Giants.

Hurls several balls of fire at once. Charging enhances potency and causes the balls of fire to explode.

There is no record of this incantation in common prayerbooks. Only a select few prelates know of its existence.
