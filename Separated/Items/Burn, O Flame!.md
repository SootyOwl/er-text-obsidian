### Burn, O Flame! [6120]

One of the incantations that draws directly from the power of the Fire Giants.

Raises a series of flame pillars around the caster. Charging further increases the number of flame pillars.

The Fire Giants borrowed from the power of a fell god, and still they were defeated. Yet their failure released them from their solitary curse: to serve as keepers of the Flame for eternity.
