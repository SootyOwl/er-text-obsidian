### About Requesting Help from Hunters [9128]

If you use a White Cipher Ring, you will automatically request for a hunter from another world to come to your rescue when your world is invaded. (Can also be used after you are invaded.)

The hunter will be summoned once the request succeeds, and their objective is to defeat the invader of your world.
