### Bloody Finger [102]

Item for online play. (Can also be used from the Multiplayer menu.)

Attempts an invasion of another player's world. If successful, you will arrive as an invader (Bloody Finger) with the objective of defeating the Host of Fingers of that world.

Glistening blood has been siphoned into the nail of this finger. Its sickly pale skin feels nothing now, but the nail still aches with sweetest pain.
