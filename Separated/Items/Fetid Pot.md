### Fetid Pot [330]

Craftable item prepared using a cracked pot. A cocktail of effluents is sealed inside. As the mixture ferments, toxins are produced alongside a putrid stench that seeps out once ripe.

Throw at enemies to cause buildup of deadly poison.

Beware though; those who carry these pots will slowly accumulate poison in their own bodies.

Push someone in a privy; expect to get dung on your hands.
