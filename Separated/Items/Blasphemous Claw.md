### Blasphemous Claw [2080]

A slab of rock engraved with traces of the Rune of Death.

Can deflect the power of the Black Blade.

On the night of the dire plot, Ranni rewarded Praetor Rykard with these traces. Should the coming trespass one day transpire, they would serve as a last-resort foil, allowing Rykard to challenge Maliketh the Black Blade, the black beast of Destined Death.
