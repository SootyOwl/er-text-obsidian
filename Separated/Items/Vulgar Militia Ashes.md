### Vulgar Militia Ashes [242000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirits of three vulgar militiamen.

Spirits of the vulgar militia who wield long-hafted, serrated hatchets. These brutal weapons are particularly effective at causing blood loss to opponents. In the Lands Between, the small were scorned, and so they formed their vulgar militia as a means to make a living, albeit in ignominy.
