### Crystalian Ashes +1 [208001]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirit of a Crystalian.

Spirit that wields round crystalline blades, both big and small. Its sturdy body, itself hewn from crystal long ago, is hard enough to blunt its opponent's blades, but blows from blunt weapons can shatter it easily.
