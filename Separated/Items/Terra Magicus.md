### Terra Magicus [4130]

One of the glintstone sorceries of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.

Draws an academy sigil upon the ground, raising the magic strength of those within.

Once, the sigil would be cast from the highest belfry of the academy, covering the entire institution's grounds. This spell allows such vivid experience of spell-casting success, it turns many a fledgling into a true sorcerer in a flash of newfound understanding.
