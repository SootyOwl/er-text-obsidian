### Blackflame Monk Amon [228000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirit of Amon, the Blackflame Monk.

Amon swore fealty to the god-slaying black flame, and so became the first fire monk to turn traitor. Or perhaps it is better said that he fled from the Giants' Flameâ€”out of cowardice.
