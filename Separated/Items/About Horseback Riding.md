### About Horseback Riding [9109]

Use the Spectral Steed Whistle to summon and ride your spectral steed.

If your spectral steed dies, you can summon it again, but it will cost one Flask of Crimson Tears to do so.

You can dismount by using the whistle again or by pressing [?keyicon@0009?](mailto:?keyicon@0009?).
