### Archer Ashes [249000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon three archer spirits.

Spirits of archers who belonged to the Fallen Hawks, a band of soldiers that once explored the Eternal City. Their arrows are imbued with cold ghostflame. Though their methods are somewhat crude, they work well as a squadron, firing a hail of arrows in unison at the sound of a war cry.
