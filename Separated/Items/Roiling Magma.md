### Roiling Magma [4820]

One of the sorceries developed from the magma of Mt. Gelmir.

Fires a lump of condensed magma that explodes a short delay after hitting the target. Charging enhances potency and further delays the explosion.

After discovering the ancient hexes of Gelmir, Rykard, son of Queen Rennala, brought them back into practical use as new forms of sorcery.
