### Haligtree Soldier Ashes [255000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirits of four Haligtree soldiers.

Spirits of common soldiers who carry the sacred light. When weakened, they explode to deliver a last-ditch attack. This was the bitter revelation discovered by the desperate soldiers who awaited the return of their lord to the rotted Haligtree.

May the flash of our deaths guide Miquella's return.
