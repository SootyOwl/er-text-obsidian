### Flame Sling [6010]

Incantation originating from a sinister prophecy.

Throws a ball of raging fire. Charging enhances potency and causes the ball of fire to explode.

The flame of ruin is anathema to the Erdtree. But prophets sometimes glimpse it within the faith all the same. Sadly when this occurs their sole reward is banishment.
