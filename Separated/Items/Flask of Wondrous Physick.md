### Flask of Wondrous Physick [251]

A relic of the physick chemists, priests of the Erdtree. Harnesses the powers of crystal tears, which only form after the passage of many moons.

Various special effects are bestowed upon the drinker, dependent on the specific mixture of crystal tears. Though currently empty, simply rest at a site of grace to replenish.

Basins are placed at the feet of Minor Erdtrees throughout the Lands Between in order to collect their crystallized tears.
