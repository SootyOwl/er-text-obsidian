### Magic Glintblade [4390]

An old sorcery of the Carian royal family.

Creates a sigil overhead, from which an enemy-seeking glintblade appears after a brief delay. This sorcery can be used while in motion. Charging increases the delay.

Said to be the prototype of the sword-phalanx sorceries wielded by royal enchanted knights.
