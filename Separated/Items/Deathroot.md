### Deathroot [2090]

A source that gives rise to Those Who Live in Death.

The beast clergyman, found at Bestial Sanctum in the distant east, collects and devours these roots.

On the night of the dire plot the stolen Rune of Death enabled the first Death of a demigod. Later, the Rune of Death spread across the Lands Between through the underground roots of the Greattree, sprouting in the form of Deathroot.
