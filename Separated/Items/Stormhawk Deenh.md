### Stormhawk Deenh [238000]

Ashen remains in which spirits yet dwell. Use to summon the spirit of Deenh the Stormhawk.

Spirit of a fierce hawk that faithfully rendered lifelong service to the old king of Stormveil long ago, when the true storm raged. Its cries embolden its fellows in battle, and the tempestuous winds that encircle it shred through foes.
