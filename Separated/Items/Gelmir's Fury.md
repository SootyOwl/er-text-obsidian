### Gelmir's Fury [4810]

One of the sorceries developed from the magma of Mt. Gelmir.

Conjures a surge of magma from the earth, covering the area. Charging extends the surge of magma.

This sorcery is held to represent the fury of the volcano, but the arrogance of attempting to harness it is solely that of men and serpents.
