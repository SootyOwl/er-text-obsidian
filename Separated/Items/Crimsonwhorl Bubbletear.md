### Crimsonwhorl Bubbletear [11020]

A crystal tear formed slowly over the ages where the Erdtree's bounty falls to the ground.

Can be mixed in the Flask of Wondrous Physick. The resulting concoction converts incoming damage into recovered HP instead. However, physical damage cannot be converted.

This effect is only brief and will quickly expire.
