### Roped Fly Pot [470]

Craftable item prepared using a cracked pot. A cocktail of effluents is sealed inside, and a short rope that aids throwing has been secured around the pot.

Throw at rearward enemies to release a swarm of flies. Their fangs inflict countless painful lacerations on the victim while the grating sound of their wings assails their sanity.

The maggots found in waste feed on blood and turn into vicious flies that are pitiably short-lived.
