### Radagon's Soreseal [1051]

This legendary talisman is an eye engraved with an Elden Rune, said to be the seal of King Consort Radagon.

Greatly raises vigor, endurance, strength, and dexterity, but also increases damage taken by a similar measure.

Solemn duty weighs upon the one beholden; not unlike a gnawing curse from which there is no deliverance.
