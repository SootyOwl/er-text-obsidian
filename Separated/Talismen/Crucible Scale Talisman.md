### Crucible Scale Talisman [4060]

A talisman fashioned from a scale that embodies the aspects of various creatures. Said to have grown on the human body long ago.

Reduces damage taken from critical hits.

A vestige of the crucible of primordial life. Born partially of devolution, it was considered a signifier of the divine in ancient times, but is now increasingly disdained as an impurity as civilization has advanced.
