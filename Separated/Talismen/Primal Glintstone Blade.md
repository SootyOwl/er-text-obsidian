### Primal Glintstone Blade [3080]

An old glintstone blade that has been stained with blood.

Reduces FP consumption of sorceries and incantations at the cost of maximum HP.

The old sorcerers would slice open their hearts with these blades to imbue a primal glintstone with their soul, and thus did they die.
