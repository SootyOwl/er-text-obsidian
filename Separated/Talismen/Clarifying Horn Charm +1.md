### Clarifying Horn Charm +1 [1181]

An accoutrement worn by the ancestral followers. Greatly raises focus. (Focus governs resistance to sleep and madness.)

Said to be a budding horn. The ancestral followers believe that the horns of a long-lived beast continue to bud like antlers, over and over again, until the beast one day becomes an ancestral spirit.
