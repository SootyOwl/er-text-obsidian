### Millicent's Prosthesis [1250]

Part of the golden prosthesis used by Millicent. The hand is locked into a fist that once raised a sword aloft.

Boosts dexterity and raises attack power with successive attacks.

The despair of sweet betrayal transformed Millicent from a mere bud into a magnificent flower. And one day, she will be rebornâ€”as a beautiful scarlet valkyrie.
