### Prince of Death's Cyst [1191]

A fetid, overgrown cyst taken from facial flesh. Greatly raises vitality. (Vitality governs resistance to the effects of Death.)

It is said that this cyst came from the corrupted visage of one unable to die a true Death. Indeed, it comes from the Prince of Death, scion of the golden bough and First of the Dead among the demigods.
