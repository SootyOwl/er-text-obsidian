### Flamedrake Talisman +1 [4021]

Talisman depicting a duo of red ancient dragons. Greatly boosts fire damage negation.

The ancient dragons, who ruled in the prehistoric era before the Erdtree, would protect their lord as a wall of living rock. And so it is that the shape of the dragon has become symbolic of all manner of protections.
