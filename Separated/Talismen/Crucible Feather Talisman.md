### Crucible Feather Talisman [4070]

A talisman fashioned from feathers that embody the aspects of various creatures. Said to have grown on the human body long ago.

Improves the effectiveness of dodge rolls, but increases damage taken at all times.

A vestige of the crucible of primordial life. Born partially of devolution, it was considered a signifier of the divine in ancient times, but is now increasingly disdained as an impurity as civilization has advanced.
