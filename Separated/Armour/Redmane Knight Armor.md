### Redmane Knight Armor [1800100]

Armor worn by knights who fought by General Radahn's side.

When they were driven to defeat by Malenia's scarlet rot, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve.

"Alas, dear home, I shan't see you again! For our duty is to remain here, a bulwark against the blight."
