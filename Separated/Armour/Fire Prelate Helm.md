### Fire Prelate Helm [360000]

Helm engraved with a sacred countenance and housing a cauldron. Attire of the Fire Prelates, commanders of the Fire Monks.

It is said the cauldron perched atop the head was originally furnished with embers, and would surge into flames when the wearer's faith reached its zenith. The fire of this cauldron has since died out, however.
