### Hoslow's Helm [650000]

A twin-tailed silver helm decorated with flowery adornments. Symbol of the head of the revered House of Hoslow.

Juno Hoslow had a younger brother who was all talk and no trousers.

His inability to commit to action was such that Juno inherited the Hoslow legacy without resistance, granting him the freedom to shower his little brother with adoration.
