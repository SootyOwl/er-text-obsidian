### Azur's Glintstone Crown [581000]

Crown of Azur, primeval current sorcerer, set with a prominent blue-green glintstone.

This crown replaced Azur's brain and skull altogether, and now, removed from his body, it is all but dead. What power remains within raises the potency of Azur's primeval current sorceries at the cost of additional FP consumption.
