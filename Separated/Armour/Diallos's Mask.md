### Diallos's Mask [651000]

Replica of a twin-tailed silver helm with flowery adornments. Only, without the twin tails.

Diallos Hoslow had an older brother who was a stern, self-possessed man of few words. His achievements made him seem out of reach.

And so the younger aspired to be like the older. Yearning for the day that he would tell the tale of House Hoslow, in blood. Knowing full well that it would break his brother's heart.
