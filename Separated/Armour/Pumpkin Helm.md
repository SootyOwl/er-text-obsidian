### Pumpkin Helm [440000]

An oval helm large enough to cover any head. Very heavy and very hard.

Reduces damage from headshots and impacts.

The inside of the helm is pitch black, keeping the crazed warrior within from panicking. Perhaps its rather roomy interior also helps alleviate feelings of pressure and claustrophobia.
