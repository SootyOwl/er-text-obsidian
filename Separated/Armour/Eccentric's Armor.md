### Eccentric's Armor [940100]

Unusually colorful armor. Worn by the knight Jerren.

Jerren preferred a nomadic existence, but after spending time as a guest of the Carian royals, he became a guest commander for General Radahn.

And for the first time, the restless tumbleweed would be bound by honorable oath.
