### Deathbed Dress [1930100]

Extremely thin and sheer white dress worn by the Deathbed Companion as she embraces the dead.

Slowly replenishes the HP of nearby allies, but not that of the wearer.

The touch of the fabric is exceedingly soft, so as not to harm even the most withered corpse, while still sharing her warmth.
