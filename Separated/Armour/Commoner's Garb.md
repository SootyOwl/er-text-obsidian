### Commoner's Garb [810100]

Garb with a thick embroidered cape attached. Standard wear for commoners of the Lands Between.

The board hung from the neck depicts a sprawling tree, its roots and branches forming two holes. This is a self-imposed shackle, a voluntary display of allegiance to the Erdtree that increases faith.
