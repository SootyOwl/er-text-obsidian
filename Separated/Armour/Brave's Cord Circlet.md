### Brave's Cord Circlet [700000]

Warrior's headband of woven leather. Garb worn by warriors of the frigid uplands.

The small flags, white cloths and sheaves of wheat often found hung from these headbands are prayers of farewell from the people of their home. In bidding farewell to warriors departing on a journey from which they aren't like to return, this small act offers only meager relief.
