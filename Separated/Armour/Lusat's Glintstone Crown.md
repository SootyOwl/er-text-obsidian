### Lusat's Glintstone Crown [580000]

The giant blue glintstone crown worn by Lusat, primeval current sorcerer.

This crown replaced Lusat's brain and skull altogether, and now, removed from his body, it is all but dead. What power remains within raises the potency of Lusat's primeval current sorceries at the cost of additional FP consumption.
