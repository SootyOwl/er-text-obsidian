### Night Maiden Twin Crown [293000]

Twin crowns worn by the nightmaidens of the Eternal City. Indicates the highest clerical rank, and hides the eyes with silk.

Long ago, the Nox invoked the ire of the Greater Will, and were banished deep underground. Now they live under a false night sky, in eternal anticipation of their liege. Of the coming age of the stars. And their Lord of Night.
