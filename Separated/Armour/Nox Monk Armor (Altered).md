### Nox Monk Armor (Altered) [291100]

Armor worn by the monks of the Eternal City.

Long ago, the Nox invoked the ire of the Greater Will, and were banished deep underground. Now they live under a false night sky, in eternal anticipation of their liege. Of the coming age of the stars. And their Lord of Night.
