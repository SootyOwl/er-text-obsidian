### Consort's Robe [960100]

Fine robe of white silk worn by Tanith, Lady of the Volcano Manor.

Long ago, when Rykard first set eyes on Tanith, she was working as a dancer in a foreign land. Soon, he made her his consort. She was the only human to remain by his side when he became the serpent of blasphemy.

In that moment, Tanith was truly charmed by him.
