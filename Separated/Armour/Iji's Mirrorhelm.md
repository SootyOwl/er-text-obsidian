### Iji's Mirrorhelm [1301000]

Helm fashioned from a crystal looking-glass, said to have never left War Counselor Iji's head. Easily broken and weak against striking attacks.

Worn by those committed to high treason, it wards off the intervention of the Greater Will and its vassal Fingers.

Iji was afraid. Terrified of his own treachery.
