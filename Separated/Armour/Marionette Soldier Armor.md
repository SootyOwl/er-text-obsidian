### Marionette Soldier Armor [840100]

Armor of metal bands arranged in a lattice. Worn by marionette soldiers, crafted to serve the sorcerers.

The construction of this armor is remarkably crude, now rusted over and severely dented.

For a doll, the only thing that matters is that it does not break.
