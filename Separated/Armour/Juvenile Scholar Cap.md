### Juvenile Scholar Cap [1030000]

Cap worn by young academy scholars, the juveniles birthed anew by the amber egg of Queen Rennala, the head of Raya Lucaria Academy.

Yet their rebirth is not without imperfections, and thus do they repeat the process, eventually becoming utterly dependent upon it.

Rebirth is as sleep to them, and with each awakening, memory fades into oblivion.
