### Malformed Dragon Gauntlets [260200]

Malformed golden gauntlets. Adorned with various dragon imagery and worn by the misshapen Tree Sentinels.

After the great ancient dragon Gransax attacked, the sentinels had an epiphany. The only way to truly protect the Erdtree was to become dragons themselves.
