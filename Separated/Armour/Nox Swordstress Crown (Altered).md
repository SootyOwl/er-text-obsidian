### Nox Swordstress Crown (Altered) [294000]

Crown worn by swordstresses of the Eternal City. The silk eye covering is removed, flaunting convention.

Long ago, the Nox invoked the ire of the Greater Will, and were banished deep underground. Now they live under a false night sky, in eternal anticipation of their liege. Of the coming age of the stars. And their Lord of Night.
