### Incantation Scarab [1901000]

Golden scarab worn directly on the head. These scarabs roll clumps of incantations during their labors.

Slightly reduces the FP costs of incantations, but increases damage taken.

As a scarab approaches death, it abandons its rolled treasure and stretches its wings wide for the long journey to its home nest.
