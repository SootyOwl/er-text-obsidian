### Elden Lord Crown [460000]

Crown of Godfrey, the first Elden Lord.

The age of the Erdtree began amongst conflict, when Godfrey was lord of the battlefield.

He led the War against the Giants. Faced the Storm Lord, alone. And then, there came a moment. When his last worthy enemy fell. And it was then, as the story is told, that the hue of Lord Godfrey's eyes faded.
