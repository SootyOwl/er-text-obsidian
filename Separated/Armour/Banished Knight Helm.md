### Banished Knight Helm [200000]

Thick, full set of armor covering the entire body. This helm was worn by knights who, whether by misfortune or misdeed, were forced to abandon their homes.

Perhaps the deep-red scarf was used to block the winds, for on the outskirts, the winds bite with a stinging fierceness.
