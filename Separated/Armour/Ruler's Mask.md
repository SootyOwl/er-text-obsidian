### Ruler's Mask [961000]

Mask in the image of a wizened sage. Customary dress among lords in a smaller nation. Increases faith.

Such a mask illustrates the qualities of an ideal lord: chiefly, wise and possessing a certain defanged geniality. One at the center of society often finds these qualities most expedient.
