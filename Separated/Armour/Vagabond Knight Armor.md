### Vagabond Knight Armor [660100]

Chest piece of a knight banished from their motherland. Dirty and battered after enduring a lengthy vagabond journey.

The crest emblazoned on the front is worn and dingy, no longer able to evoke sentiment.

Metal armor is heavy, but also sturdy, offering significant damage negation.
