### Banished Knight Armor [200100]

Thick, full set of armor covering the entire body. This armor was worn by knights who, whether by misfortune or misdeed, were forced to abandon their homes.

These fierce warriors were each and all accomplished. Perhaps that is why, despite their territorial losses, they were still named knights.
