### Guardian Garb (Full Bloom) [330100]

Engraved golden garb. Worn by the guardians of the Minor Erdtrees.

Raises the HP recovery effects of the Flask of Crimson Tears, but greatly lowers fire damage negation.

It is said that the blood-red flowers blooming on their backs mark the senescence of their ancient pact. Perhaps the guardians are part tree already.
