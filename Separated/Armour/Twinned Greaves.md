### Twinned Greaves [600300]

Greaves depicting entwined twins of gold and silver.

The two known as D are inseparable twins. They are of two bodies and two minds, but one single soul. Not once do they stand together; not one word do they speak to one another.

Perhaps this armor longs to find its way to the other D.
