### Aristocrat Coat [380100]

Tanned leather coat adorned with fine gold embroidery. Travel attire worn by nobles in the capital, and the belonging of a family which claims a knight as an ancestor.

Abandoning their birthplace after the Shattering, these undead wanderers are the pitiful product of unending life.
