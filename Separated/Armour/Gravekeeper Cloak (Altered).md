### Gravekeeper Cloak (Altered) [311100]

Defensive wear encircled by bronze snakes. Worn by gladiators who were driven from the colosseum. The wearer becomes a slightly easier target for foes.

The snake is viewed as a traitor to the Erdtree, and the audience delighted in seeing these bronze effigies beaten and battered.
