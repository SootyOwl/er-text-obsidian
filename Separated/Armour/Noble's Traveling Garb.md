### Noble's Traveling Garb [740100]

Traveling attire fashioned from metallic white silk thread. Worn by expatriated royalty.

A gift of such rare beauty, a royal wouldn't disgrace their illustrious heritage even if found dead, in a ditch, in the middle of nowhere, while wearing such splendid raiment.
