### Okina Mask [872000]

A wooden mask that depicts an old man bearing his teeth. The source of the sobriquet of the great swordsman of the Land of Reeds. Raises dexterity as it lowers focus.

The more he sharpened his mind, the more the absurdities of the world came into stark relief. And so Okina renounced it all, and rose to a higher plane. There was only himself. His katana. And its mastery.

Before long, Okina became a demon of a swordsman.
