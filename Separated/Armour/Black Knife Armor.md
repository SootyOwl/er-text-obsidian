### Black Knife Armor [180100]

Scale armor used by the Black Knife Assassins, forged to make no sound.

Traces of power yet remain in its concealing veil, which muffles the sound of footsteps.

The assassins that carried out the deeds of the Night of the Black Knives were all women, and rumored to be Numen who had close ties with Marika herself.
