### Mausoleum Knight Armor [1810100]

Armor worn by headless knights who endlessly guard the Wandering Mausoleum.

The wing-shaped ornaments on its back evoke the Deathbird. A self-inflicted curse that ties the spirits of these loyal knights to the land, having willingly beheaded themselves so that they may serve their masters in death.
