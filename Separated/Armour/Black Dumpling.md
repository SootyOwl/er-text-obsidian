### Black Dumpling [2020000]

Mask forced on a victim's head to lend torture an extra degree of cruelty. It magnifies one's fears and makes them acutely aware of all forms of pain.

Raises attack power when the wearer suffers from madness.

When the Black Dumpling goes on, the torturer no longer seeks answers; only to inflict suffering without hope of relief.
