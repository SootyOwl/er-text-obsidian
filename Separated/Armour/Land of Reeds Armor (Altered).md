### Land of Reeds Armor (Altered) [871100]

Armor made from strips of iron fastened together. Worn by warriors of the Land of Reeds.

The Land of Reeds has long been locked in a miserable civil war, during which time it has remained alienated from the cultures of its neighbors. Little wonder that the entire nation has succumbed to blood-soaked madness, or so it is said.
