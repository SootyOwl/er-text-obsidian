### Battlemage Robe [1000100]

Robe worn by scholars of the Raya Lucaria Academy scholar, tattered from being worn on the battlefield.

Whenever war broke out and the academy sealed its gates, only Haima's scholars dared venture outside. Seclusion is no way to foster discovery; it is only a convenient form of escape.
