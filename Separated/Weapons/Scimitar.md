### Scimitar [7140000]

A curved sword with a single-sided blade. Delivers slashing attacks with its sharp blade, but is ineffective against thick armor and hides covered in tough scales.

Smaller in size than most curved swords, it carves into enemies with quick, sharp cuts.### Scimitar [7140000]
