### Sword of Milos [3160000]

Sinister greatsword fashioned from a giant's backbone. The spines along each side of the blade have been tapered to a fine point and mete out wounds like a lopsided saw-blade.

Milos was undersized for a giant, and was viewed as sullied and terribly grotesque.### Sword of Milos [3160000]
