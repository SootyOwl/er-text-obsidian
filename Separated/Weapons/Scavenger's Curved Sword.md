### Scavenger's Curved Sword [7080000]

Unique curved sword, notched like shark's teeth. Weapon carried by corpse pillagers who prowl the sites of old battles.

The blade is tacky with blood and covered in hefty nicks, making it totally uneven. Life can be sinister indeed.### Scavenger's Curved Sword [7080000]
