### Vulgar Militia Shotel [18130000]

A hooked blade attached to a long handle. Wielded by the vulgar militia, its attacks can slip through an enemy's guard.

The vulgar militia are the undecorated stewards of rancid, scorched battlefields that none dare approach, and forbidden domains better forgotten by the rest of the world.### Vulgar Militia Shotel [18130000]
