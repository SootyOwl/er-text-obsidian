### Greataxe [15000000]

Greataxe akin to a huge lump of iron. Recognized as the weapon of choice of badland chieftains.

Too heavy to be wielded by those of merely ordinary strength, blows from this axe will flatten enemies, and the force of its charged attack is a sight to behold.### Greataxe [15000000]
