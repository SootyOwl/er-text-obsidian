### Miquellan Knight's Sword [2200000]

Sword forged by servants of Miquella of the Haligtree, with a design modeled after those carried by Carian knights. Instead of glintstone however, amber from the Haligtree is embedded in the blade.

A sumptuous piece, yet it has never been offered to any knight—an ill-starred sword with no master.### Miquellan Knight's Sword [2200000]
