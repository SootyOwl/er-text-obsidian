### Magma Wyrm's Scalesword [8040000]

Curved greatsword wielded by Magma Wyrms. The shape resembles a dragon's jaw and is covered in hard scales.

It's said these land-bound dragons were once humans heroes who partook in dragon communion, a grave transgression for which they were cursed to crawl the earth upon their bellies, shadows of their former selves.### Magma Wyrm's Scalesword [8040000]
