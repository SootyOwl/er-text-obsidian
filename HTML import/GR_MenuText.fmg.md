[121000] Multiplayer Password Setting

[121001] Group Password Setting

[121010] If you set a multiplayer password, you'll only be matched with other players using the same password for most multiplayer features.

However, multiplayer passwords do not apply to invasion or support multiplayer.

[121011] If you set a group password, you'll be more likely to see messages, summon signs, bloodstains, phantoms, and so on from others using the same password.

Elements given this special priority will appear differently from others.

[121100] With a Furlcalling Finger Remedy, you can see summon signs, which can be used to summon players from other worlds. (Finger Remedies are consumed with use.)

There are various types of summon signs. Gold signs summon Furled Finger cooperators. Red signs summon duelist adversaries. (For either type of multiplayer, the summoning player becomes Host of Fingers.)

[121102] You can leave a gold summon sign to play cooperative multiplayer.

This sign will appear in other players' worlds and allow them to summon you as a Furled Finger for cooperative multiplayer. Multiplayer begins once you are summoned. (Your objective will be to defeat the area boss.)

If you leave a second summon sign, the older sign will vanish.

[121104] You can leave a red summon sign to play competitive multiplayer.

This sign will appear in other players' worlds and allow them to summon you as a duelist adversary for competitive multiplayer. Multiplayer begins once you are summoned. (Your objective will be to defeat the Host of Fingers.)

If you leave a second summon sign, the older sign will vanish.

[121106] Attempt to invade another player's world as a Bloody Finger.

If you successfully invade, invasion multiplayer will begin. (Your objective will be to defeat the Host of Fingers.)

You can attempt another invasion of the same world by using a Phantom Finger item. (These items are consumed upon use.)

[121107] Cancel invasion of other world

[121108] Choose a summoned player to send back to their own world.

This player will be removed from the multiplayer session.

[121109] Removed from multiplayer session. Returning to own world.

[121110] Lures in invaders.

This allows your world to be invaded without any Furled Finger cooperators present, and it also shortens the interval between windows of opportunity for invasion.

Additionally, enables the arrival of a second invader to join when a cooperator is present. (With two invaders, the maximum number of cooperators becomes one.)

[121111] Stop beckoning invaders to your world

[121112] Puts you into a ready state to answer, should someone in another world call for rescue. You will be summoned to their world as a hunter.

Multiplayer will begin once you are summoned. (Your objective will be to defeat invaders.)

[121113] Stop accepting summons requests

[121114] Allows you to automatically request for a hunter from another world to come to your rescue when your world is invaded.

You can also use this after being invaded to summon a hunter for help. (Summoning rescuers may not always be possible.)

[121115] Cancel summons request

[121116] Send a cooperative summon sign to several nearby summoning pools (activated pools only).

If you are summoned, you will be transported to that summoning pool's location in the host player's world and multiplayer will begin. (Your objective will be to help the host player defeat the area boss.)

[121117] Remove co-op summon sign from summoning pool

[121118] Send a competitive summon sign to several nearby summoning pools (activated pools only).

If you are summoned, you will be transported to that summoning pool's location in the host player's world and multiplayer will begin. (Your objective will be to defeat the Host of Fingers.)

[121119] Remove hostile summon sign from summoning pool

[121120] Attempt to invade another player's world as a Bloody Finger.

If you successfully invade, your Festering Bloody Finger will be spent and invasion multiplayer will begin. (Your objective will be to defeat the Host of Fingers.)

You can attempt another invasion of the same world by using a Phantom Finger item. (These items are consumed upon use.)

[121121] Stop invading another world

[121122] Attempt to invade another player's world as a recusant.

If you successfully invade, invasion multiplayer will begin. (Your objective will be to defeat the Host of Fingers.)

You can attempt another invasion of the same world by using a Phantom Finger item. (These items are consumed upon use.)
